# searchTokyoNYC 
This project strove to address the following: 
-cultural differences
-how people view the world
-current events
-social parameters
-customs
-traditions
-indiviuality 

People are intrested in other peoples lives.This project was origionally supposed to just compare how common objects such as shoes and ice cream appear differently in different cultures. However, this project became an opportunity to see how diverse the world is - to see what people associate with terms - tears, sad, joy,etc. how they associate human emotion. At first I didnt even realize the power my product could have possesed. It was a really great experience during my presentation to be led by my peers and professors to see what we could reveal about humans and technology and the impact of technology through this project. During my presentation of this project people were yelling out queries that they wanted to see which shows the desire and fascination with other cultures that is inherent in all of us. 

Work that can be done: 
- translator for Chinese to refine search - would provide more data to parse through.
